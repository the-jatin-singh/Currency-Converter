# Currency-Converter
It is a currency converter application built in JavaScript that uses an API (exchangerate-api) to obtain exchange rates. In this project, we also employed a flag icons API.

### IMPORTANT
You must get your own API key (from:https://www.exchangerate-api.com/ ). Then change it on line 28 of the index.js file.
